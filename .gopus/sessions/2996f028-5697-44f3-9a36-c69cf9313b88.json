I have no memory of any previous chats you may have had with me (or another instance of Claude).\n\n**What this means:**\n- I don't know who you are\n- I can't recall past topics, preferences, or context you've shared before\n- Every conversation is independent\n\n**If you want continuity, you'd need to:**\n- Briefly remind me of relevant context at the start\n- Paste in key information from before\n- Some platforms/apps that use Claude offer memory features on their end (but that's not me remembering—it's the app storing and feeding info back to me)\n\nSo if there's something from a previous conversation you'd like to build on, just share it and we can pick up from there."
