Automation isn't about replacing yourself—it's about amplifying your impact and eliminating tedious work.\n\n## First, let's map your work\n\n**Tell me more about your specific situation:**\n\n1. **What's your primary focus?** (backend, frontend, full-stack, DevOps, ML, mobile, etc.)\n2. **What takes up most of your time?** (coding, reviews, meetings, debugging, docs, etc.)\n3. **What do you find most repetitive or tedious?**\n\n---\n\n## Common Automation Opportunities\n\nWhile you think about that, here's a framework:\n\n### 🟢 High Automation Potential\n| Task | Tools/Approaches |\n|------|------------------|\n| Boilerplate code | AI coding assistants (Copilot, Cursor, Claude) |\n| Unit test generation | AI + test frameworks |\n| Code review (first pass) | AI review tools, linters, static analysis |\n| Documentation | AI-generated docs, docstring automation |\n| Commit messages | Git hooks + AI |\n| Dependency updates | Dependabot, Renovate |\n\n### 🟡 Partial Automation\n- Debugging (AI can suggest, you verify)\n- Refactoring (AI-assisted with human judgment)\n- API integrations (templates + AI)\n\n### 🔴 Hard to Automate (Your value-add)\n- Architecture decisions\n- Stakeholder communication\n- Novel problem-solving\n- Mentoring\n\n---\n\n**What resonates most with your daily work?**",
