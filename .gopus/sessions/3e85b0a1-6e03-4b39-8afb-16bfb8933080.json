Automation isn't about replacing yourself—it's about amplifying your impact and eliminating tedious work.\n\n## First, let's map your work\n\n**Tell me more about your specific situation:**\n\n1. **What's your primary focus?** (backend, frontend, full-stack, DevOps, ML, mobile, etc.)\n2. **What takes up most of your time?** (coding, reviews, meetings, debugging, docs, etc.)\n3. **What do you find most repetitive or tedious?**\n\n---\n\n## Common Automation Opportunities\n\nWhile you think about that, here's a framework:\n\n### 🟢 High Automation Potential\n| Task | Tools/Approaches |\n|------|------------------|\n| Boilerplate code | AI coding assistants (Copilot, Cursor, Claude) |\n| Unit test generation | AI + test frameworks |\n| Code review (first pass) | AI review tools, linters, static analysis |\n| Documentation | AI-generated docs, docstring automation |\n| Commit messages | Git hooks + AI |\n| Dependency updates | Dependabot, Renovate |\n\n### 🟡 Partial Automation\n- Debugging (AI can suggest, you verify)\n- Refactoring (AI-assisted with human judgment)\n- API integrations (templates + AI)\n\n### 🔴 Hard to Automate (Your value-add)\n- Architecture decisions\n- Stakeholder communication\n- Novel problem-solving\n- Mentoring\n\n---\n\n**What resonates most with your daily work?**",

Options:\n\n### Reduce\n- Async standups (Slack bots, Loom videos)\n- \"Could this be an email?\" filter\n\n### Automate During\n- **Transcription + notes**: Fireflies, Otter, Granola, tl;dv\n- **Action item extraction**: AI summaries post-meeting\n\n### Automate After\n- Auto-generate tickets from meeting notes\n- Summary distribution to stakeholders\n\n---\n\n## Quick Wins to Start\n\n1. **Install an AI coding assistant** if you haven't\n2. **Pick one meeting type** to make async\n3. **Try a meeting transcription tool** for one week\n\n---\n\n**What backend stack are you on, and what type of meetings drain you most?** (standups, planning, 1:1s, cross-team sync?)",

      "content": "Excellent! Now I can give you **specific, actionable automation advice** for your project!\n\n---\n\n# 🎯 Gopus: Automation Opportunities\n\nYou're building **gopus** - a Go-based CLI chat client with OpenAI integration. Nice architecture!\n\n## What I See\n\n| Component | Purpose |\n|-----------|---------|\n| `openai` | API client (generated via oapi-codegen) |\n| `chat` | Interactive loop with slash commands |\n| `history` | Session persistence (JSON) |\n| `summarize` | Tiered message compression |\n| `canvas/spinner` | Braille-based terminal UI |\n| `config` | YAML configuration |\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 Automation Wins for This Project\n\n### 1. **Test Generation** (Your doc is already ahead!)\nYour `property-testing-design.md` is excellent. To automate:\n\n```bash\n# AI can generate the actual test files from your design doc\n# I can help write canvas_property_test.go right now if you want!\n```\n\n### 2. **OpenAPI Code Generation** (Already doing it ✅)\nYou're using `oapi-codegen` - great. Automate it:\n\n```makefile\n# Makefile\ngenerate:\n    oapi-codegen -package openai spec.yaml \u003e internal/openai/client_gen.go\n```\n\n### 3. **Documentation Generation**\nYour dependency diagram is manual Mermaid. Automate with:\n- `godoc` for API docs\n- Tools like `go-callvis` for auto-generated dependency graphs\n\n### 4. **Repetitive Backend Tasks I Can Help With Now**\n\n| Task | How I Can Help |\n|------|----------------|\n| Write property tests | Generate from your design doc |\n| Add new slash commands | Scaffold the handler pattern |\n| Extend config | Add new fields + validation |\n| Error handling patterns | Consistent error wrapping |\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Quick Wins With MCP\n\nSince I have file access, I can:\n\n1. **Generate `canvas_property_test.go`** from your design doc\n2. **Create a Makefile** for common tasks (generate, test, build)\n3. **Add documentation** to any package\n\n---\n\n**What would be most valuable right now?**\n- Generate the property test files?\n- Create build automation (Makefile)?\n- Something else in your workflow?",

That actually tells me a lot about where automation can help.\n\n## Your Context\n\n- **Stack**: Go backend\n- **Pain points**: Meetings + backend work\n- **Project style**: Clean architecture, minimal dependencies, good documentation\n\n---\n\n## Let's Focus: Meetings\n\nSince we can't dig into code right now, let's tackle the **meetings** side—often the bigger time sink anyway.\n\n**What types of meetings eat your time?**\n\n| Type | Typical Automation |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Standups** | Async (Slack bot, Geekbot, daily written updates) |\n| **Sprint planning** | AI pre-analysis of backlog, template-driven |\n| **Code reviews (sync)** | Move to async PR reviews + AI first-pass |\n| **1:1s** | Keep these! But automate notes/action items |\n| **Cross-team syncs** | Transcription → AI summary → async distribution |\n| **Incident reviews** | Template-driven, auto-pull metrics |\n\n---\n\n**Which of these drain you most?** \n\nOr if you want, we can go deeper on backend automation strategies (CI/CD, testing patterns, code generation) even without file access—I can give you playbooks to implement.",
